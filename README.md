# introduction_process_mining
Process mining is a family of techniques in the field of process management that support the analysis of business processes based on event logs. During process mining, specialized data mining algorithms are applied to event log data in order to identify trends, patterns and details contained in event logs recorded by an information system. Process mining aims to improve process efficiency and understanding of processes.

It captures the digital footprints from any number of systems throughout an organization and organizes them in a way that shows each step of the journey to complete that process, along with any deviations from the expected path.

In this tutorial I aim to show how to use an awesome open source library to perform Process mining (you don't need to wait until your org buy expensive commercial softwares)

Good luck and sure get in touch if you have any question or comments
